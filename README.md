# Community detection with Complex Networks
 
Understanding urban mobility patterns play a crucial role in the maintenance of infrastructure, city planning or disruptive events prevention. In my research at Leed Institute of Data Analytics, I have been investigating 2011 Census data and Telefonica Origin-Destination flows using Complex Network Analysis (CNA).

This allows us to study the dynamics of the Leeds urban mobility system and to assess the resilience of complex transportation networks. Moreover, using Community detection methods like Walktrap we can define unique functional commuting zones.
