# Community detection with Complex Networks

How we structure our cities is essential for resources allocation but also for understanding many social and economic phenomena. It is, however, unclear whether the administrative divisions, typically evolved decades ago, are taking into consideration actual social organization of cities. To provide an alternative view of urban life in Leeds, this project utilizes Complex Networks of urban flows for detection of functional commuting zones.

This allows us to study the dynamics of the Leeds urban mobility system and to assess the resilience of the transportation network. Moreover, the detection of unique functional commuting zones could be beneficial for urban planners, public transport design or epidemic outbreak management.

This research has been supervised by Nik Lomax and Nicolas Malleson.
