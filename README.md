# Community detection with Complex Networks

How we structure our cities is essential for resource allocation, but also for understanding social and economic phenomena. However, it is unclear whether the administrative divisions, many of which have been established decades ago, actually take into consideration the real social organization of cities. 

To better understand ever-evolving urban life, this research constructs networks reflecting complex travel-flow data. Using the latest research of complex networks, we uncover inherent community structure within the city of Leeds. We identified that Leeds consists of 7 functional commuting areas. Being able to identify these communities provides a unique insight into the social organization of Leeds city, improving the understanding of the functional structure of the city. The generation of these regions could be beneficial for urban planning, public transport design and even epidemic outbreak management.
