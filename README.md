# Community detection with Complex Networks

Understanding the structure of our cities, is essential for the efficient and equitable allocation of resource to urban populations. It also helps us to understand social and economic phenomena within the city, such as inequality, deprivation and levels of accessibility to key services. However, it is unclear whether the administrative divisions currently used to understand urban space, actually take into consideration the real social organization of cities. Examples include the zonation of residential population (e.g. Output Areas) or workplace population (e.g. Workplace Zones) from the census or the interaction between these spaces (e.g. Travel To Work Areas). 

To better understand ever-evolving urban life, this research constructs functional zones from networks which use complex travel-flow data. Using complex networks, we uncover inherent community structure within the UK city of Leeds. We identified that Leeds consists of 7 functional commuting areas. Being able to identify these communities provides a unique insight into the social organization of Leeds city, improving the understanding of the functional structure of the city. Identification of these functional commuting areas provides an alternative view of urban life in Leeds and could be beneficial for urban planners, public transport design or epidemic outbreak management.
